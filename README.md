# Android Experiments 1
Sampling of apps made while going through the first half of the Udemy course:  
The Complete Android Oreo Developer Course: Developing apps for Android in Java and Kotlin  
I've only included the files showing logic, layout, and design.

- BrainTrainer - learning about timers and practice with layouts - a simple timed addition quiz
- EggTimer - learning about timers, sliders, and sound - an egg-timer with sliders to control time and volume. Plays sound when time's up
